# ECE 387-Form Correcting Knee Brace
This project is an embedded system that assists users by monitoring knee instability during physical activity to ensure safe and proper rehabilitation. This project was done using an Arduino microcontroller but can be implemented on an RPI or other simliar microcontrollers with a little tweaking. 

Description project (What is it, Materials, Cost, etc.)
What happens when an Engineer tears their ACL and isn't satisfied with the leg brace the doctor issues them? They throw on a microcontroller, a couple of nifty sensors, and conjure up some code to run everything with. 

Purpose (what problem/problems does it solve? who is this built for? importance of the prototype/ proof of concept)

How do you build it?

How does it work?
