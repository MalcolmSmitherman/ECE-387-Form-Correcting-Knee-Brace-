# ECE-387-Form Correcting Knee Brace
This project is an embedded system that assists users by monitoring knee instability during physical activity to ensure safe and proper rehabilitation. This project was done using an Arduino microcontroller, but can fairly easily be implemented on an RPI or other simliar microcontrollers with a little tweaking.
